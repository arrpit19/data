Put your processed and fileld hourly timeseries files here.

The files should be in the format explained in exercice 3.

The file must contain three columns:
1.  **Date and time** in the format "YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM:SS" in UTC+1 (old name GMT+1)
2.  **Temperature** values (in Â°C)
3.  A **flag** indicating whether the value is from your HOBO station (H) or filled by regression (R)

Column separator should be a comma (`.csv`). Column names see below:
-   1st column: dttm
-   2nd column: th
-   3rd column: origin

Here is an example:
| dttm                | th    | origin |
